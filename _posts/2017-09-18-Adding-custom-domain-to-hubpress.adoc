= Adding custom domain to hubpress 

http://jaredleonmorgan.net/2016/01/12/Hub-Press-C-N-A-M-E-and-A-Records.html

When you create a hubpress account it will be hosted with github pages and have a url of www.username.github.io.  Which is harder to remember then a standered .com address.  The fix for this is relitively simple and cost me around 15 dollars.

Step 1.
you have to buy a domain.  I will be showing how to do with google's domain name service but if you fallow these steps it should work with any website domain name.

step 2

. Open the HubPress Admin Console. "username.github.io/hubpress" 
 
. Click `Settings`.

. In the CNAME field, type in your domain name. You donâ€™t need the www prefix.

. Save your changes.

This will add a cname file into your main directory in your gihtub page.  Inside the cname file will just be the url of your sites tile.

step 3 change DNS setting in domain name holder

Go to google domain and click the dns setting page

At the bottom of the page you can add DNS records. You want to add a record with the bellow qualifications

* name Blank
* type = A
* value = 192.30.252.153 and 192.30.252.164

It might will take up to a hour for your domain will be redicrected to your new domain.  If the above doesn't work check this link to see if you need to change the https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/#configuring-a-records-with-your-dns-provider[ip address in the DNS records]
