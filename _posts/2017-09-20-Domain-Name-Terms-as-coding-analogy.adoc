Records

A 
Analogy - int ARecord = 192.168.1.51
A record's hold a reference to a specific   ipv4 address.

AAAA

AAAA record's hold a reference to a ipv6 address.
Analog - long AAAARecord = 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

Cnames

Cname is a reference to another DNS records like A records
Analogy - var cNameDictionary;
    cNameDictionary["www.BestExample.com"] = ARecord
    cNameDictionary["www.anotherBestExample.com"] = ARecord
    cNameDictionary["www.ipv6BestExample.com"] = AAAARecord

// But Bellow will not work
// Because Cname can not point to actually address.  It can only point to DNS records.
cNameDictionary["www.testing.com"] = "www.working.com"
