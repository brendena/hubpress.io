## https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/best-practices#separate_html_css_and_javascript[Seperating HTMl From Javascript and CSS]

{nbsp} {nbsp} Inside of the google's app script editor you are not allowed to create file that are not html or gs file times.  Which could potential makes the practice of sepearting out your code  very hard.  To get around this they allow you to use a templating system called https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/templates[Scriptlets]. 
So instead of creating html file or javascript you file you create html file that have script or style tags inside of them and then important the entire file.

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <base target="_top">
      <?!= include('Stylesheet'); ?>
    </head>
    <body>
      <?!= include('JavaScript'); ?>
    </body>
  </html>

## https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/[Libraries] 

{nbsp} {nbsp}If you have many project that use many of the same code base you can build a library to share code between the projects.  Librarys are just static instances of a stand alone project that your sharing with other projects.  When you need to make changes to the library you have to push a new version of the library and then you have to change it from within the project that you are using the library with.
