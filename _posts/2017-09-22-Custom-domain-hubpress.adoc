= Adding custom domain to hubpress 


{nbsp}  When you create a hubpress webpage it will be hosted with github pages and have a url of www.username.github.io.  Which is harder to remember then a standered .com address.  The fix for this is relitively simple and cost me around 15 dollars.

== Step 1

{nbsp} {nbsp} You need to have a custom domain.  I will be showing how to do with google's domain name service but if you fallow these steps it should work with any website domain name.

== Step 2

. Open the HubPress Admin Console. "username.github.io/hubpress" 


 
. Click `Settings`.

. In the CNAME field, type in your domain name. You donâ€™t need the www prefix.

. Save your changes.

{nbsp} This will add a cname file into your main directory in your gihtub page.  Inside the cname file will just be the url of your sites tile.

== step 3 change DNS setting in domain name holder



{nbsp} 1. Go to google domain and click the dns setting page

{nbsp} 2. At the bottom of the page you can add DNS records. You want to add a record with the bellow qualifications

* name Blank
* type = A
* value = 192.30.252.153 and 192.30.252.164

{nbsp} It might will take up to a hour for your domain will be redicrected to your new domain.  If the above doesn't work check https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/#configuring-a-records-with-your-dns-provider[this link] to see if you need to change the ip address in the DNS records.
